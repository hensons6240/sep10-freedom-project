# SEP10 Freedom Project
by **Henson Shi**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing.

## Choosing my topic

For my project, I chose the topic of Business mostly have the ability to provide money. Besides these, other reason for picking my topic is because of its involvement in many other big ideas as business itself is quite a broad topic that can be adapted by basically anything giving me a lot more freedom when it comes to doing so. Other topics ive considered are accounting as well as finance because they, like business can help provide me with money however the diversity slims when considering what to do within that topic as it really is just one idea as a whole.Some articles I looked at for these topics were [How Technology is Transforming the Accounting Profession](https://www.njcpa.org/article/2025/01/10/how-technology-is-transforming-the-accounting-profession)" by NJCPA and [Technology's impact on Active Investing](https://partners-cap.com/insights/technologys-impact-on-active-investing) by Partner's Capital which though both interesting, however were both very limited in things they did. This ultimately came out with me choosing business as the article of [What Is Business Technology?](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/what-is-business-technology) though similair, talked about more broad ideas as well which though not affecting much, allowed me to fully consider business as my idea.
## Engineering Design Process
Currently, Im on Define portion of my project as i've only recently picked and settled in on my topic. Although i've read aboutt he causes using the link above, it doesnt seem to provide me with a problem that I need to fix using ai thus meaning I have to brainstorm on an issue that needs fixing within my topic. I plan to do this by researching more about my topic and find anything that seems still seems poorly done and hopefully find a solution that uses AI.

## Skills
### Time managment
Ive adapted the skill of time management because I tried to finish most of my work near the end of the due date and until recently realized that it wasn't going to slide as I would stress and most likely do worse on it as im rushing and not properly preparing. Even for this blog, I forgot to look at the rubric and tried my best to finish the blog based off of the examples which was kinda hard as they had certain sections I was unsure of why it was there.

### Googling
For this assignment and the previous one about looking online about our top 3 choices, I was very tempted to just use Ai Overview but realized that it wasn't really giving me what I really wanted. This forced me to properly look at websites and making sure the title matched what I was looking for and even recently, I tried searching up how to code this certain portion only for a way too advanced method by Ai Overview which I later figured out by looking at better examples.

## Summary
In conclusion, im looking forward to learn more about coding and business as I continue this project and this unuit as a whole. Business is something my family has also done for a while may allow me to learn a lot more even from home.
