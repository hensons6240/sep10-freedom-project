# SEP10 Freedom Project Blog 2.
## by Henson

## Context
Previously, I talked about the how I was apart of the Hstat Sep program and this blog is dedicated to our year long project the Freedom Project. This time Im talking about my progression onwards from blog1 and my topic of business, what I did and learned. We researched different key aspects of technology such as applications or physical electricity powered gadgets/innovations to figure out what already exist. Ive looked at sites such as [Apple](https://www.apple.com/business/docs/resources/Apps_in_Business_Getting_Started_Guide.pdf) which has many usefuls apps including [Noted](https://www.notedapp.io/), a note taking app for meetings as well as [Showpad](https://www.showpad.com/), a app that allows you to see your sales and anaylatics, providng useful data. Other than apps, I also found some very useful gadgets such as a pen scanner on [Monitask](https://www.monitask.com/en/blog/ten-must-have-gadgets-for-business-leaders-and-project-managers) and a automatic paper folder on [Office Depot](https://www.officedepot.com/b/office-equipment/N-509740) which save you a lot of time.

## Engineering Design Progress
Currently, im on step 3 of the project, **Brainstorm Possible Solutions** , where we have to figure out the solutions to existing problems within our field, in my case business. So far, ive looked at certain existing technology and gadgets  that are very useful in the field of business and now looking for solutions to existing problems that has yet to be solved by an existing app or gadget. I plan to do this by looking up problems that many major businesses may have trouble with, leading to failure in many sectors and then figuring out how ai can help fix this problem.

## Skills
* **Reflection** is a skill I believe I developed because as during the start of the semester, ive noticed that most work are pretty easy and takes minimal effort but as we approached november, the workload has gotten harder and ive been taking advantage of times where revision is possible or the teacher gives me something I can fix. This can be seen as I tried to revise my HTML writeup which already had a pretty decent score, which ended me getting a lot closer to a 10/10.

* **Logical Reasonging** is another skill I believe myself to develop because of how I usually deal with problems. Before, I depended on my either knowing the answer or not but recently Ive been actually beliveing what would most logically make sense. This can be seen science test where I wasn't sure what was considering a chemical change and saw options that looked as if they made sense such as water turning into gas which looked promising because the water took on a new form but then realized that it had to switch elements not just state of matter which ended up with me picking something that logically made more sense.

## Takeaway
 Takeaways from this project so far is how nothing is as easy as it seems which I found out from me two new skills. I really look forward to making my own solution to a problem because during the research, I found out many new things technology could do that I didn't know yet. As the project continues, I hope to also learn more about business as a whole.
