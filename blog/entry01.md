# SEP10 Freedom Project
by **Henson Shi**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing.

## Choosing my topic

For my project, I chose the topic of Business mostly have the ability to provide money. Besides these, other reason for picking my topic is because of its involvement in many other big ideas as business itself is quite a broad topic that can be adapted by basically anything giving me a lot more freedom when it comes to doing so. Other topics ive considered are accounting as well as finance because they, like business can help provide me with money however the diversity slims when considering what to do within that topic as it really is just one idea as a whole.Some articles I looked at for these topics were [How Technology is Transforming the Accounting Profession](https://www.njcpa.org/article/2025/01/10/how-technology-is-transforming-the-accounting-profession)" by NJCPA and [Technology's impact on Active Investing](https://partners-cap.com/insights/technologys-impact-on-active-investing) by Partner's Capital which though both interesting, however were both very limited in things they did. This ultimately came out with me choosing business as the article of [What Is Business Technology?](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/what-is-business-technology) though similair, talked about more broad ideas as well which though not affecting much, allowed me to fully consider business as my idea.
## Progression
Currently, Im only starting my freedom project using past knowledge of CSS and HTML and im currently learning some more about the usage of the two langauges to properly make my freedom project and to make it better as I learn more about the language and to figure out how I would like to format and design said project. Other than that, learning about the topic is very important which will be handled mostly google search engine or talking with peers as knowing to the langauge also requires me to know what to use it on.

## Skills
### Time managment
Ive adapted the skill of time management because as of 10th grade, im being needed to attend multiple extracurriculars as well as being able to enjoy myself with friends. Needing to find time to do my work not just for SEP10 as well as other classes requires me to manage my time correctly and as the year goes on, im only going to have more of a workload that needs to be done in set times.

### Googling
As SEP10 continues, im only going to need to learn more stuff and will spend most of my time on google wether to learn or remeber something. For instance, to even find my topic, I was required to search and learn about technology involvement in my top 3 choices for this exact project.

## Summary
In conclusion, im looking forward to learn more about coding and business as I continue this project and this unuit as a whole. Business is something my family has also done for a while may allow me to learn a lot more even from home.
